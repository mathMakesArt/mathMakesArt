## JEKETNUNC
In March 2021 I began [**jeketnunc**](https://github.com/jeketnunc/jeketnunc), a [**Jekyll**](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) theme for [**HicEtNunc**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz) users.
<br />
<br />
The [**MathMakesArt website**](https://mathmakes.art) serves as a live demo of this theme.
<br />
<br />
## ARTCONTRACTS
In June 2021 I launched and announced [**ArtContracts**](https://github.com/mathMakesArt/ArtContracts), a decentralized application allowing on-chain storage of artwork images and other arbitrary data on the [**Tezos**](https://tezos.com/learn/what-is-tezos/) blockchain. This is achieved via a combination of Python code (run locally before deployment), an FA2-compatible [**SmartPy**](https://smartpy.io/) contract (deployed to the blockchain) and a JavaScript template which is wrapped into an "HTML mint" NFT on [**HicEtNunc**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz) (created after contract deployment).
<br />
<br />
The [**"1" NFT (OBJKT#112092)**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/112092) serves as a live demo of this application.
<br />
The [**MATH token**](https://mathmakes.art/MATH/) is another existing deployment of the ArtContracts SmartPy contract, though its storage has yet to be used.
<br />
<br />
## MATH
In October 2021 I deployed the [**MATH token**](https://mathmakes.art/MATH/), my own custom [**Tezos**](https://tezos.com/learn/what-is-tezos/) token with FA2-compatibility.
A total of 8950 tokens were distributed between 1115 different wallet addresses, to each user who has collected at least one of my NFTs on [**HicEtNunc**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz) in the 7 months between March and September 2021.
<br />
Every user received a minimum of 1 token. The maximum number of tokens received by any user in this first distribution is 321 tokens, to Twitter user [@Anarchytect2](https://twitter.com/mathMakesArt/status/1443827161794818077).
<br />
The [**MATH contract**](https://tzkt.io/KT18hYjnko76SBVv6TaCT4kU6B32mJk6JWLZ/operations/) itself is an instance of my [**ArtContracts**](https://github.com/mathMakesArt/ArtContracts) SmartPy contract, updated for Granada and modified to best facilitate the planned uses of MATH.
<br />
<br />
**DISCLAIMER:** I am offering zero promise of present or future performance with this MATH token airdrop. This token is not intended as a monetary reward in any way, and has no associated value or exchange rate. MATH is only my own personal means of tracking supporters, and potentially offering further reward opportunities to the collectors who have supported me in the past. While I can't prevent users from privately transacting or otherwise transferring their tokens, I would like to discourage participation by any users who are seeking the token as a financial opportunity. The opportunity exists in the art itself, and in the community of my collectors who are now united under a single decentralized contract.
