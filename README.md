# JEKETNUNC
### I'm building [jeketnunc](https://github.com/jeketnunc/jeketnunc), a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) theme for [HicEtNunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz) users.
The [**MathMakesArt website**](https://mathmakes.art) serves as a live demo of this theme.
<br />
If you'd like to contribute to the project, please don't hesitate to reach out!

#### NOTE: Documentation for JEKETNUNC is in-progress and not yet released
