### Welcome to my GitHub! I'm MathMakesArt.

#### I'm also on Discord at **mathMakesArt#9728**, and I occasionally share generative artwork on Instagram at [**@MathMakesArt**](https://instagram.com/mathmakesart).
#### You can reach me by email at [**mathmakesart@gmail.com**](mailto:mathmakesart@gmail.com).

I primarily use GitHub for web hosting (via GitHub Pages).

It is written in Jekyll with a combination of HTML/JS and Markdown, styled with SCSS.

I also have a several actively-developed repositories, some of which are described below.

## JEKETNUNC
In March 2021 I began [**jeketnunc**](https://github.com/jeketnunc/jeketnunc), a [**Jekyll**](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) theme for [**HicEtNunc**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz) users.
<br />
<br />
The [**MathMakesArt website**](https://mathmakes.art) serves as a live demo of this theme.
<br />
<br />
## ARTCONTRACTS
In June 2021 I launched and announced [**ArtContracts**](https://github.com/mathMakesArt/ArtContracts), a decentralized application allowing on-chain storage of artwork images and other arbitrary data on the [**Tezos**](https://tezos.com/learn/what-is-tezos/) blockchain. This is achieved via a combination of Python code (run locally before deployment), an FA2-compatible [**SmartPy**](https://smartpy.io/) contract (deployed to the blockchain) and a JavaScript template which is wrapped into an "HTML mint" NFT on [**HicEtNunc**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz) (created after contract deployment).
<br />
<br />
The [**"1" NFT (OBJKT#112092)**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/112092) serves as a live demo of this application.
<br />
The [**MATH token**](https://mathmakes.art/MATH/) is another existing deployment of the ArtContracts SmartPy contract, though its storage has yet to be used.
<br />
<br />
## MATH
In October 2021 I deployed the [**MATH token**](https://mathmakes.art/MATH/), my own custom [**Tezos**](https://tezos.com/learn/what-is-tezos/) token with FA2-compatibility.
A total of 8950 tokens were distributed between 1115 different wallet addresses, to each user who has collected at least one of my NFTs on [**HicEtNunc**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz) in the 7 months between March and September 2021.
<br />
Every user received a minimum of 1 token. The maximum number of tokens received by any user in this first distribution is 321 tokens, to Twitter user [@Anarchytect2](https://twitter.com/mathMakesArt/status/1443827161794818077).
<br />
**DISCLAIMER:** I am offering zero promise of value or future performance with this token. Receiving this airdrop does not entitle you to any reward, monetary or otherwise. It's only my own personal means of tracking supporters, and potentially offering further reward opportunities to the collectors who have supported me in the past.
